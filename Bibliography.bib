@article{Scheffler1999,
abstract = {Magnetic resonance imaging in biochemical and clinical research requires rapid imaging sequences. Time-resolved imaging of heart movement and the acquisition of a three-dimensional image block. within the circulation time of a contrast agent bolus are two typical examples. Rapid imaging sequences are characterized by avery fast train of radiofrequency (rf) and gradient pulses. Between these rf pulses, the excited magnetization is unable to return to its thermal equilibrium. As a consequence, further rf pulses will influence both the remaining transversal and the remaining equilibrium state. The steady-state magnetization of a multi-rf pulse and gradient pulse experiment is thus a mixture or superposition of different transversal and longitudinal states and the acquired image amplitude becomes a complex function of the investigated tissue's relaxation properties. Based on the works of Woessner, Kaiser, and Hennig, this article intends to give a pictorial description of rapid multipulse imaging experiments. It also provides an extension of this theory applied to modern imaging sequences such as TRUE FISP and rf-spoiled techniques. (C) 1999 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Inc.},

@article{Weigel2015,
abstract = {The extended phase graph (EPG) concept represents a powerful tool for depicting and understanding the magnetization response of a broad variety of MR sequences. EPGs focus on echo generation as well as on classification and use a Fourier based magnetization description in terms of “configurations states”. The effect of gradients, radiofrequency (RF) pulses, relaxation, and motion phenomena during the MR sequence is characterized as the action of a few matrix operations on these configuration states. Thus, the EPG method allows for fast and precise quantitation of echo intensities even if several gradients and RF pulses are applied. EPG diagrams aid in the comprehension of different types of echoes and their corresponding echo time. Despite its several benefits in regard to a large number of problems and issues, researchers and users still often refrain from applying EPGs. It seems that “phase graphing” is still seen as a kind of “magic.” The present review investigates the foundation of EPGs and sheds light on prerequisites for adding more advanced phenomena such as diffusion. The links between diagrams and calculations are discussed. A further focus is on limitations and simplifications as well recent extensions within the EPG concept. To make the review complete, representative software for EPG coding is provided.J. Magn. Reson. Imaging 2014. {\textcopyright} 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

@article{Su2017,
abstract = {PURPOSE Assessment of brain hemodynamics without exogenous contrast agents is of increasing importance in clinical applications. This study aims to develop an MR perfusion technique that can provide noncontrast and multiparametric estimation of hemodynamic markers. METHODS We devised an arterial spin labeling (ASL) method based on the principle of MR fingerprinting (MRF), referred to as MRF-ASL. By taking advantage of the rich information contained in MRF sequence, up to seven hemodynamic parameters can be estimated concomitantly. Feasibility demonstration, flip angle optimization, comparison with Look-Locker ASL, reproducibility test, sensitivity to hypercapnia challenge, and initial clinical application in an intracranial steno-occlusive process, Moyamoya disease, were performed to evaluate this technique. RESULTS Magnetic resonance fingerprinting ASL provided estimation of up to seven parameters, including B1+, tissue T1 , cerebral blood flow (CBF), tissue bolus arrival time (BAT), pass-through arterial BAT, pass-through blood volume, and pass-through blood travel time. Coefficients of variation of the estimated parameters ranged from 0.2 to 9.6{\%}. Hypercapnia resulted in an increase in CBF by 57.7{\%}, and a decrease in BAT by 13.7 and 24.8{\%} in tissue and vessels, respectively. Patients with Moyamoya disease showed diminished CBF and lengthened BAT that could not be detected with regular ASL. CONCLUSION Magnetic resonance fingerprinting ASL is a promising technique for noncontrast, multiparametric perfusion assessment.

@misc{Hamilton2017,
abstract = {PURPOSE: To introduce a two-dimensional MR fingerprinting (MRF) technique for quantification of T1 , T2 , and M0 in myocardium. METHODS: An electrocardiograph-triggered MRF method is introduced for mapping myocardial T1 , T2 , and M0 during a single breath-hold in as short as four heartbeats. The pulse sequence uses variable flip angles, repetition times, inversion recovery times, and T2 preparation dephasing times. A dictionary of possible signal evolutions is simulated for each scan that incorporates the subject's unique variations in heart rate. Aspects of the sequence design were explored in simulations, and the accuracy and precision of cardiac MRF were assessed in a phantom study. In vivo imaging was performed at 3 Tesla in 11 volunteers to generate native parametric maps. RESULTS: T1 and T2 measurements from the proposed cardiac MRF sequence correlated well with standard spin echo measurements in the phantom study (R(2) {\textgreater} 0.99). A Bland-Altman analysis revealed good agreement for myocardial T1 measurements between MRF and MOLLI (bias 1 ms, 95{\%} limits of agreement -72 to 72 ms) and T2 measurements between MRF and T2 -prepared balanced steady-state free precession (bias, -2.6 ms; 95{\%} limits of agreement, -8.5 to 3.3 ms).

@article{Thomas1998,
abstract = {For the in vivo measurement of the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), it is desirable for the total imaging time to be as short as possible. One technique is based on a TurboFLASH acquisition in which the diffusion gradients are inserted into a driven equilibrium Fourier transform (DEFT) combination of hard pulses. However, this sequence has the disadvantage that eddy current-induced inhomogeneities lead to incomplete refocusing of the magnetization during the diffusion preparation and to incorrect ADC values. A modification to the sequence is suggested that eliminates this error by phase-cycling the second 90 degrees pulse of the preparation. This study also investigates the effect of a reduced delay time between acquisitions on the accuracy of the measurement. The quality of the TurboFLASH sequence is demonstrated by experimental validation on an agar phantom and in vivo on the rat brain using a high-field (8.5 T) system. Reduction of the interexperiment delay time is shown to be achievable to a certain degree without compromising the measurement accuracy.},

Relaxation times for the two malignant tumors were distinctly outside the range of values for the normal tissues studied, an indication that the malignant tissues were characterized by an increase in the motional freedom of tissue water molecules. The possibility of using magnetic relaxation methods for rapid discrimination between benign and malignant surgical specimens has also been considered.

abstract = {An intuitive approach is presented for assessment of the TrueFISP signal behavior in the transient phase and the steady state, based on geometrical considerations in combination with the Bloch equations. Short formulations are derived for the zenith and phase angle determining the direction of the magnetization vector for which a smooth monoexponential decay is obtained even at considerable off-resonance frequencies, thus compactly defining the target of various preparation schemes proposed in literature. A pictorial explanation is provided to illustrate how the interplay between RF excitation and relaxation governs the TrueFISP transient phase and steady state. Closed form expressions are developed that describe the signal evolution, accounting for the influence of T(1), T(2), flip angle, and resonance frequency offset in agreement with recently published studies. These results are obtained directly from basic assumptions, without the need for abstract mathematical treatment or further approximations. The validity of the conceptual framework and the analytical description is verified by simulations based on the Bloch equations as well as with MR phantom experiments. The theory may be used for contrast calculations and has the potential to facilitate improved parameter quantification with magnetization prepared TrueFISP experiments accounting for off-resonance effects.},

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-nine subjects were studied at 1.5 T. Regional T1 and T2 values were compared among groups and also with histopathologic estimates of iron concentration. RESULTS: In healthy subjects, interregional T1 and T2 differences in the cortex and basal ganglia showed a good correlation with reported values for iron concentration, and intraregional variations were generally consistent with reported variability of iron concentration. Patients with multiple system atrophy had T1 and T2 shortening in the globus pallidus consistent with reported increases in ferritin-bound iron and changes in the putamen consistent with accumulation of hemosiderin (posterior portion) and neuromelanin (remainder). Both groups of patients had changes in the cortex that are consistent with decreased ferritin concentration and T2 changes in white matter consistent with demyelination. Patients with Parkinson disease also had a (nonsignificant) T2 shortening in the substantia nigra that was suggestive of iron accumulation. CONCLUSION: Most of the T1 and T2 findings appear to be related to changes in iron content and form and may possibly be used as indicators of such changes. }

abstract = {High-field preclinical MRI scanners are now commonly used to quantitatively assess disease status and the efficacy of novel therapies in a wide variety of rodent models. Unfortunately, conventional MRI methods are highly susceptible to respiratory and cardiac motion artifacts resulting in potentially inaccurate and misleading data. We have developed an initial preclinical 7.0-T MRI implementation of the highly novel MR fingerprinting (MRF) methodology which has been described previously for clinical imaging applications. The MRF technology combines a priori variation in the MRI acquisition parameters with dictionary-based matching of acquired signal evolution profiles to simultaneously generate quantitative maps of T1 and T2 relaxation times and proton density. This preclinical MRF acquisition was constructed from a fast imaging with steady-state free precession (FISP) MRI pulse sequence to acquire 600 MRF images with both evolving T1 and T2 weighting in approximately 30 min. This initial high-field preclinical MRF investigation demonstrated reproducible and differentiated estimates of in vitro phantoms with different relaxation times. In vivo preclinical MRF results in mouse kidneys and brain tumor models demonstrated an inherent resistance to respiratory motion artifacts as well as sensitivity to known pathology. These results suggest that MRF methodology may offer the opportunity for the quantification of numerous MRI parameters for a wide variety of preclinical imaging applications.

The result is not influenced by off-resonance and it can be shown that deviations are only of second order in the small parameter TR/T2.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: B1-TRAP makes use of this effect through a frequency analysis of the transient phase of a train of steady-state free precession signals.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: In terms of reliability and time efficiency, a two-dimensional multislice implementation was found to be optimal.

abstract = {In balanced steady-state free precession (b-SSFP) sequences, uncompensated first-order moments of encoding gradients induce a nonconstant phase evolution for moving spins within the excitation train, resulting in signal loss and image artifacts. To restore these flow-related phase perturbations, "pairing" of consecutive phase-encoding (PE) steps is compared with a fully flow-compensated sequence using compensating gradient waveforms along all three encoding directions. In volunteer studies, the quality of images acquired with the "pairing" technique was comparable to that of images obtained with the fully flow-compensated technique, regardless of the selected view-ordering scheme used for data acquisition. Nevertheless, the results of phantom experiments indicate that the pairing technique becomes ineffective at flow velocities exceeding roughly 0.5-1 m/s. Consequently, the additional scan time required to null the first gradient moments in a flow-compensated b-SSFP sequence makes the "pairing" technique preferable for applications in which slow to moderate flow velocities can be expected.},

abstract = {Absfrucf-Selective excitation pulses are used in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to isolate a specific slice through the subject. The pulse design problem is in general nonlinear due to the nonlinearity of the Bloch equation. Recently a direct solution has been proposed by Shin-nar and his co-workers [1]-[6], and Le Roux [7]-[9]. In this paper we first present an overview of the Shinnar-Le Roux (SLR) algorithm. We then show how the performance of SLR pulses can be very accurately specified analytically. This is useful because it tells how to design a pulse that produces a specified slice profile. More importantly, it allows the pulse designer to trade-off analytically the parameters describing the pulse performance. We present several ex-amples to illustrate the more important trade-offs. These include lin-ear-phase and minimum-and maximum-phase pulses. Linear-phase pulses can be refocused with a gradient reversal, and can be used as spin-echo pulses. Minimum-and maximum-phase pulses have better slice profiles, but cannot be completely refocused.},

abstract = {Purpose The aim of this study was to investigate a technique for improving the performance of Magnetic Resonance Fingerprinting (MRF) in repetitive sampling schemes, in particular for 3D MRF acquisition, by shortening relaxation intervals between MRF pulse train repetitions. Material and methods A calculation method for MRF dictionaries adapted to short relaxation intervals and non-relaxed initial spin states is presented, based on the concept of stationary fingerprints. The method is applicable to many different k-space sampling schemes in 2D and 3D. For accuracy analysis, T1and T2values of a phantom are determined by single-slice Cartesian MRF for different relaxation intervals and are compared with quantitative reference measurements. The relevance of slice profile effects is also investigated in this case. To further illustrate the capabilities of the method, an application to in-vivo spiral 3D MRF measurements is demonstrated. Results The proposed computation method enables accurate parameter estimation even for the shortest relaxation intervals, as investigated for different sampling patterns in 2D and 3D. In 2D Cartesian measurements, we achieved a scan acceleration of more than a factor of two, while maintaining acceptable accuracy: The largest T1values of a sample set deviated from their reference values by 0.3{\%} (longest relaxation interval) and 2.4{\%} (shortest relaxation interval). The largest T2values showed systematic deviations of up to 10{\%} for all relaxation intervals, which is discussed. The influence of slice profile effects for multislice acquisition is shown to become increasingly relevant for short relaxation intervals. In 3D spiral measurements, a scan time reduction of 36{\%} was achieved, maintaining the quality of in-vivo T1 and T2 maps. Conclusions Reducing the relaxation interval between MRF sequence repetitions using stationary fingerprint dictionaries is a feasible method to improve the scan efficiency of MRF sequences. The method enables fast implementations of 3D spatially resolved MRF.},

abstract = {Sequence optimization and appropriate sequence selection is still an unmet need in magnetic resonance fingerprinting (MRF). The main challenge in MRF sequence design is the lack of an appropriate measure of the sequence's encoding capability. To find such a measure, three different candidates for judging the encoding capability have been investigated: local and global dot-product-based measures judging dictionary entry similarity as well as a Monte Carlo method that evaluates the noise propagation properties of an MRF sequence. Consistency of these measures for different sequence lengths as well as the capability to predict actual sequence performance in both phantom and in vivo measurements was analyzed. While the dot-product-based measures yielded inconsistent results for different sequence lengths, the Monte Carlo method was in a good agreement with phantom experiments. In particular, the Monte Carlo method could accurately predict the performance of different flip angle patterns in actual measurements. The proposed Monte Carlo method provides an appropriate measure of MRF sequence encoding capability and may be used for sequence optimization.},

We aimed to extend this technique to cases with B1 + inhomogeneities within the imaging volume. Previous approaches have used abrupt changes in flip angles to estimate the B1 + field simultaneously with T1 and T2, using a Cartesian approach in a small-animal scanner at 4.7 T. Here, we evaluated whether a similar approach would be suitable for imaging human brains using spiral readouts with a 7 T scanner. We found that our modified scheme could significantly reduce the adverse effects of B1 + inhomogeneities even in extreme cases, reducing both the bias and the variance in T2 estimations by an order of magnitude when compared to literature methods. Acquisitions used less than 1.5 W/kg SAR and could be performed in 12 s per slice. In conclusion, our approach can be used to perform quantitative imaging of the brain at 7 T in a short time, simultaneously estimating the B1 + profile.},

abstract = {Purpose: To investigate possible errors in T1 and T2 quantification via MR fingerprinting with balanced steady-state free precession readout in the presence of intra-voxel phase dispersion and RF pulse profile imperfections, using computer simulations based on Bloch equations. Materials and methods: A pulse sequence with TR changing in a Perlin noise pattern and a nearly sinusoidal pattern of flip angle following an initial 180-degree inversion pulse was employed. Gaussian distributions of off-resonance frequency were assumed for intra-voxel phase dispersion effects. Slice profiles of sinc-shaped RF pulses were computed to investigate flip angle profile influences. Following identification of the best fit between the acquisition signals and those established in the dictionary based on known parameters, estimation errors were reported. In vivo experiments were performed at 3. T to examine the results. Results: Slight intra-voxel phase dispersion with standard deviations from 1 to 3. Hz resulted in prominent T2 under-estimations, particularly at large T2 values. T1 and off-resonance frequencies were relatively unaffected. Slice profile imperfections led to under-estimations of T1, which became greater as regional off-resonance frequencies increased, but could be corrected by including slice profile effects in the dictionary. Results from brain imaging experiments in vivo agreed with the simulation results qualitatively. Conclusion: MR fingerprinting using balanced SSFP readout in the presence of intra-voxel phase dispersion and imperfect slice profile leads to inaccuracies in quantitative estimations of the relaxation times.},

abstract = {Magnetic resonance fingerprinting (MR fingerprinting or MRF) is a newly introduced quantitative magnetic resonance imaging technique, which enables simultaneous multi-parameter mapping in a single acquisition with improved time efficiency. The current MRF reconstruction method is based on dictionary matching, which may be limited by the discrete and finite nature of the dictionary and the computational cost associated with dictionary construction, storage and matching.In this paper, we describe a reconstruction method based on Kalman filter for MRF, which avoids the use of dictionary to obtain continuous MR parameter measurements. With this Kalman filter framework, the Bloch equation of inversion-recovery balanced steady state free-precession (IR-bSSFP) MRF sequence was derived to predict signal evolution, and acquired signal was entered to update the prediction. The algorithm can gradually estimate the accurate MR parameters during the recursive calculation. Single pixel and numeric brain phantom simulation were implemented with Kalman filter and the results were compared with those from dictionary matching reconstruction algorithm to demonstrate the feasibility and assess the performance of Kalman filter algorithm.The results demonstrated that Kalman filter algorithm is applicable for MRF reconstruction, eliminating the need for a pre-define dictionary and obtaining continuous MR parameter in contrast to the dictionary matching algorithm.},

The method performs the reconstruction entirely in k-space and is related to low rank matrix completion methods. A low dimensional data subspace is estimated from a small number of k-space locations fully sampled in the temporal direction and used to reconstruct the missing k-space samples before MRF dictionary matching. Performing the iterations in k-space eliminates the need for applying a forward and an inverse Fourier transform in each iteration required in previously proposed iterative reconstruction methods for undersampled MRF data. A projection onto the low dimensional data subspace is performed as a matrix multiplication instead of a singular value thresholding typically used in low rank matrix completion, further reducing the computational complexity of the reconstruction. The method is theoretically described and validated in phantom and in-vivo experiments. The quality of the parameter maps can be significantly improved compared to direct matching on undersampled data.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: We incorporate simultaneous multislice (SMS) acquisition into MR fingerprinting (MRF) to accelerate the MRF acquisition.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: The t-Blipped SMS-MRF method is achieved by adding a Gz blip before each data acquisition window and balancing it with a Gz blip of opposing polarity at the end of each TR. Thus the signal from different simultaneously excited slices are encoded with different phases without disturbing the signal evolution. Furthermore, by varying the Gz blip area and/or polarity as a function of repetition time, the slices' differential phase can also be made to vary as a function of time. For reconstruction of t-Blipped SMS-MRF data, we demonstrate a combined slice-direction SENSE and modified dictionary matching method.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: In Monte Carlo simulation, the parameter mapping from multiband factor (MB) = 2 t-Blipped SMS-MRF shows good accuracy and precision when compared with results from reference conventional MRF data with concordance correlation coefficients (CCC) of 0.96 for T1 estimates and 0.90 for T2 estimates.

abstract = {PURPOSE To reduce the acquisition time needed to obtain reliable parametric maps with Magnetic Resonance Fingerprinting. METHODS An iterative-denoising algorithm is initialized by reconstructing the MRF image series at low image resolution. For subsequent iterations, the method enforces pixel-wise fidelity to the best-matching dictionary template then enforces fidelity to the acquired data at slightly higher spatial resolution. After convergence, parametric maps with desirable spatial resolution are obtained through template matching of the final image series. The proposed method was evaluated on phantom and in vivo data using the highly undersampled, variable-density spiral trajectory and compared with the original MRF method. The benefits of additional sparsity constraints were also evaluated. When available, gold standard parameter maps were used to quantify the performance of each method. RESULTS The proposed approach allowed convergence to accurate parametric maps with as few as 300 time points of acquisition, as compared to 1000 in the original MRF work. Simultaneous quantification of T1, T2, proton density (PD), and B0 field variations in the brain was achieved in vivo for a 256 × 256 matrix for a total acquisition time of 10.2 s, representing a three-fold reduction in acquisition time.

Here, we extend the method to incorporate B1 estimation.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: The acquisition is based on steady state free precession MR fingerprinting with a Cartesian trajectory. To increase the sensitivity to the B1 profile, abrupt changes in flip angle were introduced in the sequence. Slice profile and B1 effects were included in the dictionary and the results from two- and three-dimensional (3D) acquisitions were compared. Acceleration was demonstrated using retrospective undersampling in the phase encode directions of 3D data exploiting redundancy between MRF frames at the edges of k-space.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Without B1 estimation, T2 and B1 were inaccurate by more than 20{\%}. Abrupt changes in flip angle improved B1 maps. T1 and T2 values obtained with the new MRF methods agree with classical spin echo measurements and are independent of the B1 field profile. When using view sharing reconstruction, results remained accurate (error {\textless}10{\%}) when sampling under 10{\%} of k-space from the 3D data.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: The methods demonstrated here can successfully measure T1, T2, and B1.

abstract = {PURPOSE This article discusses the signal behavior in the case the flip angle in steady-state free precession sequences is continuously varied as suggested for MR-fingerprinting sequences. Flip angle variations prevent the establishment of a steady state and introduce instabilities regarding to magnetic field inhomogeneities and intravoxel dephasing. We show how a pseudo steady state can be achieved, which restores the spin echo nature of steady-state free precession. METHODS Based on geometrical considerations, relationships between the flip angle, repetition and echo time are derived that suffice to the establishment of a pseudo steady state. The theory is tested with Bloch simulations as well as phantom and in vivo experiments. RESULTS A typical steady-state free precession passband can be restored with the proposed conditions. The stability of the pseudo steady state is demonstrated by comparing the evolution of the signal of a single isochromat to one resulting from a spin ensemble. As confirmed by experiments, magnetization in a pseudo steady state can be described with fewer degrees of freedom compared to the original fingerprinting and the pseudo steady state results in more reliable parameter maps. CONCLUSION The proposed conditions restore the spin-echo-like signal behavior typical for steady-state free precession in fingerprinting sequences, making this approach more robust to B0 variations.

abstract = {Magnetic resonance fingerprinting is a technique for acquiring and processing MR data that simultaneously provides quantitative maps of different tissue parameters through a pattern recognition algorithm. A predefined dictionary models the possible signal evolutions simulated using the Bloch equations with different combinations of various MR parameters and pattern recognition is completed by computing the inner product between the observed signal and each of the predicted signals within the dictionary. Though this matching algorithm has been shown to accurately predict the MR parameters of interest, one desires a more efficient method to obtain the quantitative images. We propose to compress the dictionary using the singular value decomposition (SVD), which will provide a low-rank approximation. By compressing the size of the dictionary in the time domain, we are able to speed up the pattern recognition algorithm, by a factor of between 3.4-4.8, without sacrificing the high signal-to-noise ratio of the original scheme presented previously.},

abstract = {In this study, we evaluated an MRI fingerprinting approach (MRvF) designed to provide high-resolution parametric maps of the microvascular architecture (i.e., blood volume fraction, vessel diameter) and function (blood oxygenation) simultaneously. The method was tested in rats (n = 115), divided in 3 models: brain tumors (9 L, C6, F98), permanent stroke, and a control group of healthy animals. We showed that fingerprinting can robustly distinguish between healthy and pathological brain tissues with different behaviors in tumor and stroke models. In particular, fingerprinting revealed that C6 and F98 glioma models have similar signatures while 9 L present a distinct evolution. We also showed that it is possible to improve the results of MRvF and obtain supplemental information by changing the numerical representation of the vascular network. Finally, good agreement was found between MRvF and conventional MR approaches in healthy tissues and in the C6, F98, and permanent stroke models. For the 9 L glioma model, fingerprinting showed blood oxygenation measurements that contradict results obtained with a quantitative BOLD approach. In conclusion, MR vascular fingerprinting seems to be an efficient technique to study microvascular properties in vivo. Multiple technical improvements are feasible and might improve diagnosis and management of brain diseases.},

abstract = {In the present study, we describe a fingerprinting approach to analyze the time evolution of the MR signal and retrieve quantitative information about the microvascular network. We used a Gradient Echo Sampling of the Free Induction Decay and Spin Echo (GESFIDE) sequence and defined a fingerprint as the ratio of signals acquired pre- and post-injection of an iron-based contrast agent. We then simulated the same experiment with an advanced numerical tool that takes a virtual voxel containing blood vessels as input, then computes microscopic magnetic fields and water diffusion effects, and eventually derives the expected MR signal evolution. The parameter inputs of the simulations (cerebral blood volume [CBV], mean vessel radius [R], and blood oxygen saturation [SO2]) were varied to obtain a dictionary of all possible signal evolutions. The best fit between the observed fingerprint and the dictionary was then determined by using least square minimization. This approach was evaluated in 5 normal subjects and the results were compared to those obtained by using more conventional MR methods, steady-state contrast imaging for CBV and R and a global measure of oxygenation obtained from the superior sagittal sinus for SO2. The fingerprinting method enabled the creation of high-resolution parametric maps of the microvascular network showing expected contrast and fine details. Numerical values in gray matter (CBV=3.1??0.7{\%}, R=12.6??2.4??m, SO2=59.5??4.7{\%}) are consistent with literature reports and correlated with conventional MR approaches. SO2 values in white matter (53.0??4.0{\%}) were slightly lower than expected. Numerous improvements can easily be made and the method should be useful to study brain pathologies. ?? 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

@article{Hahn1950,
abstract = {Intense radiofrequency power in the form of pulses is applied to an ensemble of spins in a liquid placed in a large static magnetic field H0. The frequency of the pulsed r-f power satisfies the condition for nuclear magnetic resonance, and the pulses last for times which are short compared with the time in which the nutating macroscopic magnetic moment of the entire spin ensemble can decay. After removal of the pulses a non-equilibrium configuration of isochromatic macroscopic moments remains in which the moment vectors precess freely. Each moment vector has a magnitude at a given precession frequency which is determined by the distribution of Larmor frequencies imposed upon the ensemble by inhomogeneities in H0. At times determined by pulse sequences applied in the past the constructive interference of these moment vectors gives rise to observable spontaneous nuclear induction signals. The properties and underlying principles of these spin echo signals are discussed with use of the Bloch theory. Relaxation times are measured directly and accurately from the measurement of echo amplitudes. An analysis includes the effect on relaxation measurements of the self-diffusion of liquid molecules which contain resonant nuclei. Preliminary studies are made of several effects associated with spin echoes, including the observed shifts in magnetic resonance frequency of spins due to magnetic shielding of nuclei contained in molecules.},

abstract = {The magnetic moments of nuclei in normal matter will result in a nuclear paramagnetic polarization upon establishment of equilibrium in a constant magnetic field. It is shown that a radiofrequency field at right angles to the constant field causes a forced precession of the total polarization around the constant field with decreasing latitude as the Larmor frequency approaches adiabatically the frequency of the r-f field. Thus there results a component of the nuclear polarization at right angles to both the constant and the r-f field and it is shown that under normal laboratory conditions this component can induce observable voltages. In Section 3 we discuss this nuclear induction, considering the effect of external fields only, while in Section 4 those modifications are described which originate from internal fields and finite relaxation times.},

@article{Deshmane2012,
abstract = {Parallel imaging is a robust method for accelerating the acquisition of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data, and has made possible many new applications of MR imaging. Parallel imaging works by acquiring a reduced amount of k-space data with an array of receiver coils. These undersampled data can be acquired more quickly, but the undersampling leads to aliased images. One of several parallel imaging algorithms can then be used to reconstruct artifact-free images from either the aliased images (SENSE-type reconstruction) or from the undersampled data (GRAPPA-type reconstruction). The advantages of parallel imaging in a clinical setting include faster image acquisition, which can be used, for instance, to shorten breath-hold times resulting in fewer motion-corrupted examinations. In this article the basic concepts behind parallel imaging are introduced. The relationship between undersampling and aliasing is discussed and two commonly used parallel imaging methods, SENSE and GRAPPA, are explained in detail. Examples of artifacts arising from parallel imaging are shown and ways to detect and mitigate these artifacts are described. Finally, several current applications of parallel imaging are presented and recent advancements and promising research in parallel imaging are briefly reviewed.},

Cardiac image sequences obtained with the balanced PR-FFE method are compared with images obtained with a spin-warp (2D Fourier transform (2DFT)) technique. In particular, the representation of motion artifacts in both techniques is investigated. Balanced PR-FFE provides a similar contrast to spin-warp-related techniques, but is less sensitive to motion artifacts. The use of angular undersampling within balanced PR-FFE is examined as a means to increase temporal resolution while causing only minor artifacts. Furthermore, a modification of the profile order allows the reconstruction of PR images at different spatial and temporal resolution levels from the same data. This study shows that balanced PR-FFE is a robust tool for cardiac function studies.},

abstract = {Non-Cartesian parallel imaging has played an important role in reducing data acquisition time in MRI. The use of non-Cartesian trajectories can enable more efficient coverage of k-space, which can be leveraged to reduce scan times. These trajectories can be undersampled to achieve even faster scan times, but the resulting images may contain aliasing artifacts. Just as Cartesian parallel imaging can be used to reconstruct images from undersampled Cartesian data, non-Cartesian parallel imaging methods can mitigate aliasing artifacts by using additional spatial encoding information in the form of the nonhomogeneous sensitivities of multi-coil phased arrays. This review will begin with an overview of non-Cartesian k-space trajectories and their sampling properties, followed by an in-depth discussion of several selected non-Cartesian parallel imaging algorithms. Three representative non-Cartesian parallel imaging methods will be described, including Conjugate Gradient SENSE (CG SENSE), non-Cartesian generalized autocalibrating partially parallel acquisition (GRAPPA), and Iterative Self-Consistent Parallel Imaging Reconstruction (SPIRiT). After a discussion of these three techniques, several potential promising clinical applications of non-Cartesian parallel imaging will be covered.},

Using this new bSSFP signal model, quantitative MT model parameters such as the fractional pool size, corresponding magnetization exchange rates, and relaxation times are estimated in human brain. The results show high correlation with the ones from standard methods, but benefit from bSSFP's short acquisition times and high signal-to-noise ratios. This allows the acquisition of isotropic high resolution quantitative MT maps within clinically feasible acquisition times.},

This proposed spiral-scan echo planar imaging (SEPI) technique employs two linearly increasing sinusoidal gradient fields, which results in a spiral trajectory in the spatial frequency domain (k-domain) that covers the entire frequency domain uniformly. The advantages of the method are: 1) circularly symmetric T2 weighting, resulting in a circularly symmetric point spread function in the image domain; 2) elimination of discontinuities in gradient waveforms which in turn will reduce initial transient as well as steady-state distortions; and 3) effective rapid spiral-scan from dc to high frequency in a continuous fashion, which ensures multiple pulsing with interlacing for further resolution improvement without T2 decay image degradation. Some preliminary experimental results will be presented and further possible improvements suggested.},

Signal generated from outside the field of view appears as a superimposed object at the opposite edge of the image. Increasing the field of view, changing the gradient axes relative to the patient, or use of surface coils can reduce aliasing and are parameters which are controlled by the radiologist/technologist. The manufacturer may provide software packages which exploit two additional strategies, either limiting the volume of the patient from which the MR signal is acquired as in Inner Volume Imaging or display of only the central portion of the acquisition field of view. Increasing the field of view will decrease spatial resolution unless the number of phase encoding steps is increased at a cost of increased acquisition time. The radiologist may in some clinical situations choose to tolerate aliasing in favor of improved resolution in the area of interest and decreased acquisition time. {\textcopyright} 1988.},

abstract = {In this study, a novel partially parallel acquisition (PPA) method is presented which can be used to accelerate image acquisition using an RF coil array for spatial encoding. This technique, GeneRalized Autocalibrating Partially Parallel Acquisitions (GRAPPA) is an extension of both the PILS and VD-AUTO-SMASH reconstruction techniques. As in those previous methods, a detailed, highly accurate RF field map is not needed prior to reconstruction in GRAPPA. This information is obtained from several k-space lines which are acquired in addition to the normal image acquisition. As in PILS, the GRAPPA reconstruction algorithm provides unaliased images from each component coil prior to image combination. This results in even higher SNR and better image quality since the steps of image reconstruction and image combination are performed in separate steps. After introducing the GRAPPA technique, primary focus is given to issues related to the practical implementation of GRAPPA, including the reconstruction algorithm as well as analysis of SNR in the resulting images. Finally, in vivo GRAPPA images are shown which demonstrate the utility of the technique.},

@article{Pruessmann1999,
abstract = {New theoretical and practical concepts are presented for considerably enhancing the performance of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) by means of arrays of multiple receiver coils. Sensitivity encoding (SENSE) is based on the fact that receiver sensitivity generally has an encoding effect complementary to Fourier preparation by linear field gradients. Thus, by using multiple receiver coils in parallel scan time in Fourier imaging can be considerably reduced. The problem of image reconstruction from sensitivity encoded data is formulated in a general fashion and solved for arbitrary coil configurations and k-space sampling patterns. Special attention is given to the currently most practical case, namely, sampling a common Cartesian grid with reduced density. For this case the feasibility of the proposed methods was verified both in vitro and in vivo. Scan time was reduced to one-half using a two-coil array in brain imaging. With an array of five coils double-oblique heart images were obtained in one-third of conventional scan time. Magn Reson Med 42:952-962, 1999.},

@article{Seiberlich2008,
abstract = {Self-calibrating GRAPPA operator gridding (GROG) is a method by which non-Cartesian MRI data can be gridded using spatial information from a multichannel coil array without the need for an additional calibration dataset. Using self-calibrating GROG, the non-Cartesian datapoints are shifted to nearby k-space locations using parallel imaging weight sets determined from the datapoints themselves. GROG employs the GRAPPA Operator, a special formulation of the general reconstruction method GRAPPA, to perform these shifts. Although GROG can be used to grid undersampled datasets, it is important to note that this method uses parallel imaging only for gridding, and not to reconstruct artifact-free images from undersampled data. The innovation introduced here, namely, self-calibrating GROG, allows the shift operators to be calculated directly out of the non-Cartesian data themselves. This eliminates the need for an additional calibration dataset, which reduces the imaging time and also makes the GROG reconstruction more robust by removing possible inconsistencies between the calibration and non-Cartesian datasets. Simulated and in vivo examples of radial and spiral datasets gridded using self-calibrating GROG are compared to images gridded using the standard method of convolution gridding.},

abstract = {A model-based dynamic MRI called k-t BLAST/SENSE has drawn significant attention from the MR imaging community because of its improved spatio-temporal resolution. Recently, we showed that the k-t BLAST/SENSE corresponds to the special case of a new dynamic MRI algorithm called k-t FOCUSS that is optimal from a compressed sensing perspective. The main contribution of this article is an extension of k-t FOCUSS to a more general framework with prediction and residual encoding, where the prediction provides an initial estimate and the residual encoding takes care of the remaining residual signals. Two prediction methods, RIGR and motion estimation/compensation scheme, are proposed, which significantly sparsify the residual signals. Then, using a more sophisticated random sampling pattern and optimized temporal transform, the residual signal can be effectively estimated from a very small number of k-t samples. Experimental results show that excellent reconstruction can be achieved even from severely limited k-t samples without aliasing artifacts.},

These techniques improve the performance of dynamic imaging significantly across multiple clinical applications, including cardiac functional examinations, perfusion imaging, blood flow assessment, contrast-enhanced angiography, functional MRI, and interventional imaging, among others. The scan acceleration permits higher spatial resolution, increased temporal resolution, shorter scan duration, or a combination of these benefits. Along with the exciting developments is a dizzying proliferation of acronyms and variations of the techniques.

@article{Tsao2003,
abstract = {Dynamic images of natural objects exhibit significant correlations in k-space and time. Thus, it is feasible to acquire only a reduced amount of data and recover the missing portion afterwards. This leads to an improved temporal resolution, or an improved spatial resolution for a given amount of acquisition. Based on this approach, two methods were developed to significantly improve the performance of dynamic imaging, named k-t BLAST (Broad-use Linear Acquisition Speed-up Technique) and k-t SENSE (SENSitivity Encoding) for use with a single or multiple receiver coils, respectively. Signal correlations were learned from a small set of training data and the missing data were recovered using all available information in a consistent and integral manner. The general theory of k-t BLAST and k-t SENSE is applicable to arbitrary k-space trajectories, time-varying coil sensitivities, and under- and overdetermined reconstruction problems. Examples from ungated cardiac imaging demonstrate a 4-fold acceleration (voxel size 2.42 x 2.52 mm(2), 38.4 fps) with either one or six receiver coils. k-t BLAST and k-t SENSE are applicable to many areas, especially those exhibiting quasiperiodic motion, such as imaging of the heart, the lungs, the abdomen, and the brain under periodic stimulation.},

@article{Haldar2011,
abstract = {Compressed sensing (CS) has the potential to reduce magnetic resonance (MR) data acquisition time. In order for CS-based imaging schemes to be effective, the signal of interest should be sparse or compressible in a known representation, and the measurement scheme should have good mathematical properties with respect to this representation. While MR images are often compressible, the second requirement is often only weakly satisfied with respect to commonly used Fourier encoding schemes. This paper investigates the use of random encoding for CS-MRI, in an effort to emulate the "universal" encoding schemes suggested by the theoretical CS literature. This random encoding is achieved experimentally with tailored spatially-selective radio-frequency (RF) pulses. Both simulation and experimental studies were conducted to investigate the imaging properties of this new scheme with respect to Fourier schemes. Results indicate that random encoding has the potential to outperform conventional encoding in certain scenarios. However, our study also indicates that random encoding fails to satisfy theoretical sufficient conditions for stable and accurate CS reconstruction in many scenarios of interest. Therefore, there is still no general theoretical performance guarantee for CS-MRI, with or without random encoding, and CS-based methods should be developed and validated carefully in the context of specific applications.},

@article{Lustig2007,
abstract = {The sparsity which is implicit in MR images is exploited to significantly undersample k-space. Some MR images such as angiograms are already sparse in the pixel representation; other, more complicated images have a sparse representation in some transform domain-for example, in terms of spatial finite-differences or their wavelet coefficients. According to the recently developed mathematical theory of compressed-sensing, images with a sparse representation can be recovered from randomly undersampled k-space data, provided an appropriate nonlinear recovery scheme is used. Intuitively, artifacts due to random undersampling add as noise-like interference. In the sparse transform domain the significant coefficients stand out above the interference. A nonlinear thresholding scheme can recover the sparse coefficients, effectively recovering the image itself. In this article, practical incoherent undersampling schemes are developed and analyzed by means of their aliasing interference. Incoherence is introduced by pseudo-random variable-density undersampling of phase-encodes. The reconstruction is performed by minimizing the l(1) norm of a transformed image, subject to data fidelity constraints. Examples demonstrate improved spatial resolution and accelerated acquisition for multislice fast spin-echo brain imaging and 3D contrast enhanced angiography.},

abstract = {The k-t broad-use linear acquisition speed-up technique (BLAST) has become widespread for reducing image acquisition time in dynamic MRI. In its basic form k-t BLAST speeds up the data acquisition by undersampling k-space over time (referred to as k-t space). The resulting aliasing is resolved in the Fourier reciprocal x-f space (x = spatial position, f = temporal frequency) using an adaptive filter derived from a low-resolution estimate of the signal covariance. However, this filtering process tends to increase the reconstruction error or lower the achievable acceleration factor. This is problematic in applications exhibiting a broad range of temporal frequencies such as free-breathing myocardial perfusion imaging. We show that temporal basis functions calculated by subjecting the training data to principal component analysis (PCA) can be used to constrain the reconstruction such that the temporal resolution is improved. The presented method is called k-t PCA.},

@article{Fortin2016,
abstract = {PURPOSE: During the last decades, magnetic resonance angiography has been used as a clinical routine for precise and non-invasive exploration of vessels, as well as for diagnosis of the most current neurovascular diseases. Several dedicated codes were developed to simulate specifically the process of arbitrarily complex flow imaging. Though, currently, most of advanced MRI simulators do not include this option and are specialized in static tissues imaging. This work was carried out to expand the possibilities of one of those simulators in order to propose a complete full-featured tool for simulation of any MR experience including flow motion. THEORY AND METHODS: An extension of JEMRIS, one of the most prevalent high performance open-source software for MRI simulation to date, is presented. Implementing a Lagrangian description of individual spins motion in the code makes possible to simulate any MR experience including both static tissues and arbitrarily complex flow. RESULTS: The efficiency of this approach is proven by replicating some specific angiographic pulse sequences, such as phase contrast velocimetry, time-of-flight sequence and contrast-enhanced imaging. The appearance of a common flow artifact (misregistration artifact) on an usual acquisition is also reproduced. At last, a simulation of phase contrast on a realistic vessel geometry is presented. Those results include flow data based on theoretical flow model as well as complex numerical data obtained from Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). CONCLUSION: The framework introduced provides an efficient and versatile tool for simulation of any MRI experience including physiological fluids with arbitrarily complex flow motion.},

abstract = {Diffusion Weighted (DW) MRI allows for the non-invasive study of water diffusion inside living tissues. As such, it is useful for the investigation of human brain white matter (WM) connectivity in vivo through fiber tractography (FT) algorithms. Many DW-MRI tailored restoration techniques and FT algorithms have been developed. However, it is not clear how accurately these methods reproduce the WM bundle characteristics in real-world conditions, such as in the presence of noise, partial volume effect, and a limited spatial and angular resolution. The difficulty lies in the lack of a realistic brain phantom on the one hand, and a sufficiently accurate way of modeling the acquisition-related degradation on the other. This paper proposes a software phantom that approximates a human brain to a high degree of realism and that can incorporate complex brain-like structural features. We refer to it as a Diffusion BRAIN (D-BRAIN) phantom. Also, we propose an accurate model of a (DW) MRI acquisition protocol to allow for validation of methods in realistic conditions with data imperfections. The phantom model simulates anatomical and diffusion properties for multiple brain tissue components, and can serve as a ground-truth to evaluate FT algorithms, among others. The simulation of the acquisition process allows one to include noise, partial volume effects, and limited spatial and angular resolution in the images. In this way, the effect of image artifacts on, for instance, fiber tractography can be investigated with great detail. The proposed framework enables reliable and quantitative evaluation of DW-MR image processing and FT algorithms at the level of large-scale WM structures. The effect of noise levels and other data characteristics on cortico-cortical connectivity and tractography-based grey matter parcellation can be investigated as well.},

@article{Collins1995,
abstract = {Explicit segmentation is required for many forms of quantitative neuroanatomic analysis. However, manual methods are time-consuming and subject to errors in both accuracy and reproducibility (precision). A 3-D model-based segmentation method is presented in this paper for the completely automatic identification and delineation of gross anatomical structures of the human brain based on their appearance in magnetic resonance images (MRI).The approach depends on a general, iterative, hierarchical non-linear registration procedure and a 3-D digital model of human brain anatomy that contains both volumetric intensity-based data and a geometric atlas. Here, the traditional segmentation strategy is inverted: instead of matching geometric contours from and idealized atlas directly to the MRI data, segmentation is achieved by identifying the non-linear spatial transformation that best maps corresponding intensity-based features between a model image and a new MRI brain volume. When completed, atlas contours defined on the model image are mapped through the same transformation to segment and label individual structures in the new data set.Using manually segmented sturcture boundaries for comparison, measures of volumetric difference and volumetric overlap were less than 2{\%} and better than 97{\%} for realistic brain phantom data, and less than 10{\%} and better than 85{\%}, respectively, for human MRI data. This compares favorably to intra-observer variability estimates of 4.9{\%} and 87{\%}, respectively. The procedure performs well, is objective and its implementation robust. The procedure requires no manual intervention, and is thus applicable to studies of large numbers of subjects. The general method for non-linear image matching is also useful for non-linear mapping of brain data sets into stereotaxic space if the target volume is already in stereotaxic space. {\textcopyright} 1995 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

@article{Drobnjak2010,
abstract = {Transient magnetic fields induce changes in magnetic resonance (MR) images ranging from small, visually undetectable effects (caused, for instance, by neuronal currents) to more significant ones, such as those created by the gradient fields and eddy currents. Accurately simulating these effects may assist in correcting or optimising MR imaging for many applications (e.g., diffusion imaging, current density imaging, use of magnetic contrast agents, neuronal current imaging, etc.). Here we have extended an existing MR simulator (POSSUM) with a model for changing magnetic fields at a very high-resolution time-scale. This simulator captures a realistic range of scanner and physiological artifacts by modeling the scanner environment, pulse sequence details and subject properties (e.g., brain geometry and air-tissue boundaries).The simulations were validated by using previously published experimental data sets. In the first dataset a transient magnetic field was produced by a single conducting wire with varying current amplitude (between 17 ??A and 765 ??A). The second was identical except that current amplitude was fixed (at 7.8 mA) and current timing varied. A very close match between simulated images and experimental data was observed. In addition, these validation results led to the observation that the current-induced effects included ringing in the image, which extended away from the conductor, primarily in the phase-encode direction. This effect had previously not been noticed in the noisy, experimentally-acquired images, demonstrating one way in which simulated images can provide potential insight into imaging experiments. ?? 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {More than a dozen Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) imaging methods have been described using different radio-frequency pulse sequences, magnetic field gradient variations, and data processing. In order to have a theoretical understanding in the most general case, we have conceived a computer program for the simulation of NMR imaging techniques. The algorithm uses the solution of the Bloch equations at each point of a simulated object. The direction of every elementary magnetic moment is computed at each instant, and stored in an array giving the global signal to be processed, whatever the pulse and gradient sequence. To test the validity of this program, we have simulated some well-known experimental results. Some applications are presented which contribute to the understanding of image distortions and to techniques such as selective radio-frequency pulse or oscillating gradients. This program can be used to unravel physical and technological causes of image distortions, to have a "microscopic" look at any parameter of an experiment, and to study the contrast given by various NMR imaging techniques as a function of the three NMR parameters, i.e., the hydrogen nuclei density $\rho${\{}variant{\}} and the relaxation times T1 and T2. {\textcopyright} 1984.},

MRiLab combines realistic tissue modeling with numerical virtualization of an MRI system and scanning experiment to enable assessment of a broad range of MRI approaches including advanced quantitative MRI methods inferring microstructure on a sub-voxel level. A flexible rep-resentation of tissue microstructure is achieved in MRiLab by employing the generalized tissue model with multiple exchanging water and macromolecular proton pools rather than a system of independent proton isochromats typi-cally used in previous simulators. The computational power needed for simulation of the biologically relevant tissue models in large 3D objects is gained using parallelized execution on GPU. Three simulated and one actual MRI experiments were performed to demonstrate the ability of the new simulator to accommodate a wide variety of voxel composition scenarios and demonstrate detrimental effects of simplified treatment of tissue micro-organization adapted in previous simulators. GPU execution allowed ∼ 200× improvement in computational speed over standard CPU. As a cross-platform, open-source, extensible environment for customizing virtual MRI experiments, MRiLab stream-lines the development of new MRI methods, especially those aiming to infer quantitatively tissue composition and microstructure.

abstract = {In this paper we demonstrate a simulation framework that enables the direct and quantitative comparison of post-processing methods for diffusion weighted magnetic resonance (DW-MR) images. DW-MR datasets are employed in a range of techniques that enable estimates of local microstructure and global connectivity in the brain. These techniques require full alignment of images across the dataset, but this is rarely the case. Artefacts such as eddy-current (EC) distortion and motion lead to misalignment between images, which compromise the quality of the microstructural measures obtained from them. Numerous methods and software packages exist to correct these artefacts, some of which have become de-facto standards, but none have been subject to rigorous validation. In the literature, improved alignment is assessed using either qualitative visual measures or quantitative surrogate metrics. Here we introduce a simulation framework that allows for the direct, quantitative assessment of techniques, enabling objective comparisons of existing and future methods. DW-MR datasets are generated using a process that is based on the physics ofMRI acquisition, which allows for the salient features of the images and their artefacts to be reproduced. We apply this framework in three ways. Firstly we assess the most commonly used method for artefact correction, FSL's eddy{\_}correct, and compare it to a recently proposed alternative, eddy. We demonstrate quantitatively that using eddy{\_}correct leads to significant errors in the corrected data, whilst eddy is able to provide much improved correction. Secondly we investigate the datasets required to achieve good correction with eddy, by looking at the minimum number of directions required and comparing the recommended full-sphere acquisitions to equivalent half-sphere protocols. Finally, we investigate the impact of correction quality by examining the fits frommicrostructure models to real and simulated data.},

The development was driven by the desire to achieve generality of simulated three-dimensional MRI experiments reflecting modern MRI systems hardware. The accompanying computational burden is overcome by means of parallel computing. Many aspects are covered that have not hitherto been simultaneously investigated in general MRI simulations such as parallel transmit and receive, important off-resonance effects, nonlinear gradients, and arbitrary spatiotemporal parameter variations at different levels. The latter can be used to simulate various types of motion, for instance. The JEMRIS user interface is very simple to use, but nevertheless it presents few limitations. MRI sequences with arbitrary waveforms and complex interdependent modules are modeled in a graphical user interface-based environment requiring no further programming.

@article{Drobnjak2006,
abstract = {Functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI) is a noninvasive method of imaging brain function in vivo. However, images produced in FMRI experiments are imperfect and contain several artifacts that contaminate the data. These artifacts include rigid-body motion effects, B0-field inhomogeneities, chemical shift, and eddy currents. To investigate these artifacts, with the eventual aim of minimizing or removing them completely, a computational model of the FMR image acquisition process was built that can simulate all of the above-mentioned artifacts. This paper gives an overview of the development of the FMRI simulator. The simulator uses the Bloch equations together with a geometric definition of the object (brain) and a varying T2* model for the BOLD activations. Furthermore, it simulates rigid-body motion of the object by solving Bloch equations for given motion parameters that are defined for an object moving continuously in time, including during the read-out period, which is a novel approach in the area of MRI computer simulations. With this approach it is possible, in a controlled and precise way, to simulate the full effects of various rigid-body motion artifacts in FMRI data (e.g. spin-history effects, B0-motion interaction, and within-scan motion blurring) and therefore formulate and test algorithms for their reduction.},

@article{Yoder2004,
abstract = {A new MRI simulator has been developed that generates images of realistic objects for arbitrary pulse sequences executed in the presence of static field inhomogeneities, including those due to magnetic susceptibility, variations in the applied field, and chemical shift. In contrast to previous simulators, this system generates object-specific inhomogeneity patterns from first principles and propagates the consequent frequency offsets and intravoxel dephasing through the acquisition protocols to produce images with realistic artifacts. The simulator consists of two parts. The input to part 1 is a set of "susceptibility voxels" that describe the magnetic properties of the object being imaged. It calculates a frequency offset for each voxel by computing the size of the static field offset at each voxel in the image based on the magnetic susceptibility of each tissue type within all voxels. The method of calculation is a three-dimensional convolution of the susceptibility-voxels with a kernel derived from a previously published method and takes advantage of the superposition principle to include voxels with mixtures of substances of differing susceptibilities. Part 2 produces both a signal and a reconstructed image. Its inputs include a voxel-based description of the object, frequency offsets computed by part 1, applied static field errors, chemical shift values, and a description of the imaging protocol. Intravoxel variations in both static field and time-dependent phase are calculated for each voxel. Validations of part 1 are presented for a known analytic solution and for experimental data from two phantoms. Part 2 was validated with comparisons to an independent simulation provided by the Montreal Neurological Institute and experimental data from a phantom. ?? 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Cluster classification techniques have proved the most popular for volume measurement, yet little attention has been paid to how the choice of images for analysis affects the quality and ease of segmentation. To address this issue, we have developed a system to simulate MRI cluster plots using multicompartmental anthropomorphic software models of anatomy, and components for image contrast, signal-to-noise ratio, image nonuniformity, tissue heterogeneity, imager field strength, the partial volume effect, correlation between proton density, T1 and T2, and a variety of data preprocessing techniques. The effect of these components on tissue cluster size, shape, orientation, and separation is demonstrated. The simulation allows an informed choice of pulse sequence, acquisition parameters, and data preprocessing for cluster classification to be made as well as providing an aid to interpretation of acquired data cluster plots and a valuable educational tool. The system has been used to choose suitable images for neurological segmentation of grey matter, white matter, CSF, and multiple sclerosis lesions using spin-echo, inversion recovery, and gradient- echo pulse sequences. Constraints on image selection are discussed.},

The aim was to develop a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) simulator that makes no assumptions with respect to the underlying pulse sequence and also allows for complex large-scale analysis on a single computer without requiring simplifications of the MRI model. We hypothesized that such a simulation platform could be developed with parallel acceleration of the executable core within the graphic processing unit (GPU) environment. MRISIMUL integrates realistic aspects of the MRI experiment from signal generation to image formation and solves the entire complex problem for densely spaced isochromats and for a densely spaced time axis.

The MRISIMUL simulator imaged three different computer models: a user-defined phantom, a human brain model and a human heart model. The high computational power of GPU-based simulations was compared against other computer configurations. A speedup of about 228 times was achieved when compared to serially executed C-code on the CPU whereas a speedup between 31 to 115 times was achieved when compared to the OpenMP parallel executed C-code on the CPU, depending on the number of threads used in multithreading (2-8 threads). The high performance of MRISIMUL allows its application in large-scale analysis and can bring the computational power of a supercomputer or a large computer cluster to a single GPU personal computer.},

From this, the synthetic images are calculated pixel by pixel on the basis of the well-known formulas of the pulse sequences chosen and modified by the user. The graphical user interface is oriented to a real-world MR scanner. The software is programmed in pure Java and is freely available under the GPL license. Besides spin echo pulse sequence, 6 other pulse sequence classes are implemented. Parameters like repetition time and echo time can be adjusted. The choice of parameters like matrix size, slice-thickness, and number of acquisitions has an impact on the signal-to-noise ratio of the images. In a first step, the simulation calculates the signal intensity in k-space. Wraparound and motion artifacts are simulated by modifying the data of k-space. In a last step, a 2D-Fourier transform of k-space data is performed. As the image calculation takes only a few seconds, an interactive manner of working is possible.

The results demonstrated that the calculation speed using two GPU boards was typically about 7 TFLOPS and about 14 times faster than the calculation speed using CPUs (two 18-core Xeons). We also found that MR images acquired by experiment could be reproduced using an appropriate number of subvoxels, and that 3D isotropic and two-dimensional multislice imaging experiments for practical matrix sizes could be simulated using the MRI simulator.

Validation of in vivo MRI studies is complicated by a lack of reference data and the difficulty of constructing anatomically realistic physical phantoms. We present here an extensible MRI simulator that efficiently generates realistic three-dimensional (3-D) brain images using a hybrid Bloch equation and tissue template simulation that accounts for image contrast, partial volume, and noise. This allows image analysis methods to be evaluated with controlled degradations of image data.},

This simulation is novel in that complex imaging phenomena, such as chemical shifts and flow, may be easily studied. Other features include spin warp and backprojection imaging, movie generation, and simulation of image contrast, composite pulse sequences, motion artifacts, aliasing, selective excitation, field inhomogeneity, noise and signal averaging. The simulation incorporates fast Fourier transform and graphics modules for processing and display of one- and two-dimensional images. Examples which illustrate features of the program are shown. The simulation is a useful tool for both the sophisticated and the beginning user of NMR imaging.

abstract = {The authors previously described magnetic resonance (MR) image synthesis, a process that enables the investigator to manipulate imaging parameters retrospectively and generate or "synthesize" the image that corresponds to various arbitrary scanning factors. They demonstrate the validity and utility of synthetic spin-echo images in cerebral imaging. As a test of their method, spin-echo images are synthesized for echo times identical to those of the original acquired images as well as for alternate values. Subjectively, the quality of synthetic and acquired images is comparable. It is shown quantitatively for several tissue types that the reconstructed synthetic signal matches the acquired signal within the uncertainty of the acquired images. Observed and measured noise levels in the acquired and synthetic images are comparable. Because of a signal-averaging effect, the synthetic images can have a higher signal-to-noise ratio than the source images, thereby providing improved boundary definition. Applications of MR image synthesis are discussed with respect to potential reduction in scanning time. The advantages of image synthesis versus analysis of computed images are discussed.},

abstract = {The authors describe an automated technique of magnetic resonance (MR) image synthesis. Given a specific pulse sequence, MR signals are acquired for several pulse delay and/or repetition times and used to compute images of intrinsic parameters T1, T2, and N(H). Both the computed images and operator-specified pulse delay and repetition times are then used to "synthesize" a new image based on equations descriptive of MR signal behavior and comparable to that acquired by using the operator-specified parameters in an actual MR study. Instrumentation enabling rapid operator-interactive generation of synthesized images is described and initial results presented, allowing for dependence of the signal on T2 in spin echo images. Extension to full T1, T2, and N(H) dependence for arbitrary pulse sequences is described. Major advantages of this technique include retrospective optimization of contrast between arbitrary materials, rapid and systematic image analysis, and reduced scanning time; potential limitations include accuracy, noise, motion artifacts, and multicomponent behavior.},

@article{Ortendahl1984,
abstract = {The response of different magnetic resonance (MR) techniques to tissue parameters - T1, T2, and N(H) - is a determinant of clinical efficacy. The large possible number of imaging techniques and range of variable parameters for each make it difficult to perform exhaustive evaluations in a single patient or even in animal models. In addition, changes in operating magnetic field strength change the relaxation times sufficiently so that the efficacy of a technique at a given field does not imply similar results at another field value. Tools are demonstrated that permit the evaluation of the efficacy of any model of response to tissue parameters, and also allow the investigation of the effects of changing magnetic field. Global maps of signal difference between tissues as well as calculated images are obtainable from a minimally sufficient data set. These tools serve as an important adjunct to experimental work.},

@article{Morrow2000,
abstract = {Since its appearance in the early 1980's, Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) has taken its place as a major player in the noninvasive diagnosis of disease. It is the imaging modality of choice for detecting abnormalities of the brain, spine and musculoskeletal systems. It is on the verge of widespread application in diagnosis of cardiovascular disease and in image guided surgery. While permanent and resistive magnets are used for low field applications ({\&}ldquo;open{\&}rdquo; MRI) most systems use high field superconducting magnets making MRI the largest commercial application of superconductivity. The MRI magnet is the largest and most expensive component in the MRI system. Magnet configuration is the determining factor in MRI system architecture and directly connected to issues such as patient comfort, ease of siting, life cycle cost and functionality. All of these factors drive magnet requirements. Thus, MRI magnet requirements are determined by a combination of MRI system needs, technical requirements and market forces, plus the need for continuous reduction of both magnet-acquisition cost and total cost of ownership. Cost of ownership, in turn, includes siting, installation, operation and service. In this paper we trace the evolution of superconducting MRI magnet systems-taking note of the importance of advances in cryogenic technology and design practice-as they have responded to both market forces and competing magnet technologies},

Of primary use in the producition of highly homogeneous fields for nuclear magnetic resonance studies, the paper details the analysis of fields in terms of spherical harmonics, describes how field plotting in the appropriate manner may be used to obtain a direct measure of which harmonics are present, and shows how to combine basic “building blocks” to produce the various lower-order zonal and tesseral harmonics. “Building blocks” described include coils, arcs, and sinusoids of current as well as rings and arcs of steel. The use of shaped magnets is also briefly mentioned. Attention is drawn to the presence, in high-order designs, of possibly dominant lower orders of harmonics created by errors in fabrication. The goal of the paper is to present a design philosophy, backed by the appropriate mathematics, which is applicable to the variety of situations encountered in magnet design. Practical examples of correcting coils and ‘‘shims'' are also given.},

abstract = {Quality control of the magnetic resonance imagers of different vendors in the clinical environment is non-harmonised, and comparing the performance is difficult. The purpose of this study was to develop and apply a harmonised long-term quality control protocol for the six imagers in our organisation in order to assure that they fulfil the same basic image quality requirements. The same Eurospin phantom set and identical imaging parameters were used with each imager. Values of 11 comparable parameters describing the image quality were measured. Automatic image analysis software was developed to objectively analyse the images. The results proved that the imagers were operating at a performance level adequate for clinical imaging. Some deficiencies were detected in image uniformity and geometry. The automated analysis of the Eurospin phantom images was successful. The measurements were successfully repeated after 2 weeks on one imager and after half a year on all imagers. As an objective way of examining the image quality, this kind of comparable and objective quality control of different imagers is considered as an essential step towards harmonisation of the clinical MRI studies through a large hospital organisation. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag 2004.},

abstract = {The high information content of MRI exams brings with it unintended effects, which we call artifacts. The purpose of this review is to promote understanding of these artifacts, so they can be prevented or properly interpreted to optimize diagnostic effectiveness. We begin by addressing static magnetic field uniformity, which is essential for many techniques, such as fat saturation. Eddy currents, resulting from imperfect gradient pulses, are especially problematic for new techniques that depend on high performance gradient switching. Nonuniformity of the transmit radiofrequency system constitutes another source of artifacts, which are increasingly important as magnetic field strength increases. Defects in the receive portion of the radiofrequency system have become a more complex source of problems as the number of radiofrequency coils, and the sophistication of the analysis of their received signals, has increased. Unwanted signals and noise spikes have many causes, often manifesting as zipper or banding artifacts. These image alterations become particularly severe and complex when they are combined with aliasing effects. Aliasing is one of several phenomena addressed in our final section, on artifacts that derive from encoding the MR signals to produce images, also including those related to parallel imaging, chemical shift, motion, and image subtraction.

abstract = {PURPOSE Atherosclerotic carotid plaques can be quantified in vivo by MRI. However, the accuracy in segmentation and quantification of components such as the thin fibrous cap (FC) and lipid-rich necrotic core (LRNC) remains unknown due to the lack of a submillimeter scale ground truth. METHODS A novel approach was taken by numerically simulating in vivo carotid MRI providing a ground truth comparison. Upon evaluation of a simulated clinical protocol, MR readers segmented simulated images of cross-sectional plaque geometries derived from histological data of 12 patients. RESULTS MR readers showed high correlation (R) and intraclass correlation (ICC) in measuring the luminal area (R = 0.996, ICC = 0.99), vessel wall area (R = 0.96, ICC = 0.94) and LRNC area (R = 0.95, ICC = 0.94). LRNC area was underestimated (mean error, -24{\%}). Minimum FC thickness showed a mediocre correlation and intraclass correlation (R = 0.71, ICC = 0.69). CONCLUSION Current clinical MRI can quantify carotid plaques but shows limitations for thin FC thickness quantification. These limitations could influence the reliability of carotid MRI for assessing plaque rupture risk associated with FC thickness. Overall, MRI simulations provide a feasible methodology for assessing segmentation and quantification accuracy, as well as for improving scan protocol design.},

abstract = {PURPOSE Implementing new magnetic resonance experiments, or sequences, often involves extensive programming on vendor-specific platforms, which can be time consuming and costly. This situation is exacerbated when research sequences need to be implemented on several platforms simultaneously, for example, at different field strengths. This work presents an alternative programming environment that is hardware-independent, open-source, and promotes rapid sequence prototyping. METHODS A novel file format is described to efficiently store the hardware events and timing information required for an MR pulse sequence. Platform-dependent interpreter modules convert the file to appropriate instructions to run the sequence on MR hardware. Sequences can be designed in high-level languages, such as MATLAB, or with a graphical interface. Spin physics simulation tools are incorporated into the framework, allowing for comparison between real and virtual experiments. RESULTS Minimal effort is required to implement relatively advanced sequences using the tools provided. Sequences are executed on three different MR platforms, demonstrating the flexibility of the approach. CONCLUSION A high-level, flexible and hardware-independent approach to sequence programming is ideal for the rapid development of new sequences. The framework is currently not suitable for large patient studies or routine scanning although this would be possible with deeper integration into existing workflows.
