Magnetic Resonance Imaging simulation systems are an essential tool for a variety of research topics.
For example, in the field of pulse sequence optimisation, MRI simulations allow for the differentiation between hardware imperfections and the effects of MR physics, 
while in the field of correction algorithms, simulated data sets can provide the needed ground truth.
Moreover, controlled numerical MRI experiments can also be used for educational purposes.
This chapter presents an overview of both past and present MRI simulation systems.
The first section focuses on surveying the current literature in terms of MRI simulation, while the second section discusses the features of currently available MRI simulators.
Finally, the third section presents the more specific case of a Magnetic Resonance Fingerprinting experiment and how the current literature has simulated this novel sequence.

% The aim of my PhD is to develop and apply a simulation system for Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), capable of producing realistic datasets along with their artefacts.
% To enable an effective investigation of how commonly occurring MR artefacts affect these datasets, we focus our attention towards a novel quantitative MRI technique called Magnetic Resonance Fingerprinting (MRF).
% In order to achieve our goal, we begin with an investigation of existing MRI simulation systems, focusing on the current state-of-the-art.
% The first three sections are focused on general MR systems, while the last section discusses Magnetic Resonance Fingerprinting simulations.

%The first section of this chapter will provide a thorough review of existing MR simulation systems, focusing on the current state-of-the-art and a discussion of their limitations, while the second section will discuss current MRF simulations.
%, with a focus on how motion corrupted MRF reconstructions have been simulated.
