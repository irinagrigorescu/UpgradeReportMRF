%In this work we demonstrated that there is a need to have a realistic MRI simulation framework to accurately and precisely investigate the nature of commonly occurring MRI artefacts.
%Although others before us have succeeded in developing MR simulators capable of constructing MRI datasets (see Chapter \ref{chapterlabel2secMRISIMULATORS}), there are limitations that need to be overcome in order to push the research towards more advanced sequences such as magnetic resonance fingerprinting (see Chapter \ref{chapterlabel2sec2}).

The main aim of this PhD project is to develop a magnetic resonance imaging simulation framework capable of simulating advanced MR sequences and to demonstrate its application on a novel quantitative MRI protocol known as magnetic resonance fingerprinting (MRF).
