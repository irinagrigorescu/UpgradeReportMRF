\section{Contributions to Date}\label{chapterlabel4sec1}

Towards this aim I have made the following contributions:

\begin{enumerate}

	\item Carried out a study of the relevant background theory for understanding Magnetic Resonance Imaging (Appendix \ref{appendixlabelBackgroundMRI}) and Magnetic Resonance Fingerprinting (Appendix \ref{appendixlabelBackgroundMRF}).
	
	\item Carried out a comprehensive literature review consisting of the current state-of-the-art in both Magnetic Resonance Imaging (Chapter \ref{chapterlabel2sec1} and Chapter \ref{chapterlabel2secMRISIMULATORS}) and Magnetic Resonance Fingerprinting simulation systems (Chapter \ref{chapterlabel2sec2}).
	%Additionally, as a result of this study, we provide a generalised software framework for an ideal MRI simulator that can serve as a guideline for the MRI simulation community worldwide (Chapter \ref{chapterlabel4sec2}).
	
	\item Implemented a proof-of-concept simulation framework for a Magnetic Resonance Fingerprinting experiment in an open-source simulator called JEMRIS \cite{Stocker2010}.
	Our choice of simulator environment was based on the availability of a sequence development tool offered with the simulator.
	Our implementation involved the development of the original MRF sequence \cite{Ma2013}.
	Additionally, we have investigated the impact of in-plane motion beginning at various time points during the scan.
	This framework and our results are detailed in Chapter \ref{chapterlabel3}.
